# Conway's Game of Life

[### View Demo](https://hquach-cs.github.io/GameOfLife/)

This project is my open source visualization of Conway's "Game of Life". Game of life is a cellular automata that works based on an initial state. 

## Skills

With this project, I attended to learn some tools/skills for professional use:

* Simple Cellular Automata
* JS

## Experience

I started this project to begin my journey as a machine learning programmer. Game of Life is a simple cellular automata example that can be easly accompolish. I created a simple visualization in HTML/CSS with JS being the main langauge for the algorithm. 

## Features
Options:
1. Sec: seconds before update
1. Seed: random generator seed
1. Grid Width/ Grid Height: size of grid
1. Population Chance: random chance of being a initial cell
1. Start/Stop: start and stop button to begin "Game of Life"

## Future
* Make site look better through css
* Optimize Algorithm
